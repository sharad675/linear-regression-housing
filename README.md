# Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features from the Ames Housing dataset.

## Contents

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Performance metrics:
  - MAE: 20,191.10
  - RMSE: 33,373.65
  - R² Score: 0.8611
- Visualizations:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Actual vs Predicted scatter plot
  - Residuals distribution
  - Feature importance
  - SHAP summary plot

##  Objective

The goal of this analysis was to build a simple, interpretable regression model to estimate housing prices accurately and understand which features are most impactful.

##  Notes

- Dataset: AmesHousing.csv
- Preprocessing was done using standard group methods (null handling, encoding)
- This is part of a group coursework and represents the **Linear Regression** portion
